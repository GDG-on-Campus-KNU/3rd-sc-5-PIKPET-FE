## upcoming_updates
### Implementation of notification service using Firebase
Before visiting a shelter, we use Firebase to receive notifications from the shelter. This allows users to receive updates on animals they have expressed interest in.
### Addition of Breeder Certification System
Especially for breeders, there is also an opinion that they cannot be trusted, as the operators of puppy mills can pretend to be professional breeders without requiring specific qualifications.
we aim to manage the transaction records of breeders to determine if they are certified users.
